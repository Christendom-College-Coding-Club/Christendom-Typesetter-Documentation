# Command Line Usage
The Windows version of Christendom
Typesetter includes a helpful CLI named
"cdomtex".
To use it, add the location 
"C:/Users/\<your username\>/ChristendomTypesetter"
to your PATH environment variable.
Now, you can run the program from the
terminal, which is useful for those of
us who use terminal-based text editors
like Vim. To open Christendom Typesetter
to the current directory, run
```
cdomtex .
```
To open the GUI directory picker, simply
run
```
cdomtex
```
To open Christendom Typesetter at some
other location, type
```
cdomtex <file path>
```
