# Getting Started with Cdomtex

### Step 1: Download and run installer
Follow the instructions on the [download page](https://www.christendom.dev/cdomtex/download)
to get the the correct installer on to
your computer, and run the installer.
This will install Christendom Formatter
on your device.


### Step 2: Set up a new essay
Using Christendom Formatter is designed
to work in tandem with good 
computer organization.
Create a new folder to hold everything
related to your essay. Make sure the
folder is in a convenient place, where
you won't have trouble finding it again.
Open Christendom Formatter, click the
button that says "No Directory
Selected," and select
your folder with the file explorer that
pops up.

### Step 3: Start writing!
Create a new text file in your folder,
and start
writing. Save that text file, go to your
Christendom Formatter window, and click
New Paragraph. Select your file from the
list that pops up, and it will appear in
Christendom Formatter! The system is set
up this way so that you are free to
split your paper up into multiple text
files, which makes finding specific
parts a lot easier.

#### Step 4: Save your essay as PDF
Click the "Compile to PDF" button, 
and Christendom Formatter will save your
essay as a PDF in its folder, and
automatically open it in a browser tab.
