# Getting Started with Christendom Typesetter

### Step 1: Download and run installer
Follow the instructions on the [download page](https://www.christendom.dev/cdomtex/download)
to get the the correct installer on to
your computer, and run the installer.
This will install Christendom Typesetter
on your device. 
- Windows may alert you
that the installer is from an unknown
publisher. If you trust that this
program does not contain malware, 
click "more" and then "run anyway."


### Step 2: Set up a new essay
Christendom Typesetter is designed
to work in tandem with good 
computer organization.
Create a new folder to hold everything
related to your essay. Make sure the
folder is in a convenient place, where
you won't have trouble finding it again.
Open Christendom Typesetter, click the
button that says "No Directory
Selected," and select
your folder with the file explorer that
pops up.

### Step 3: Start writing!
Create a new text file (.txt) in your folder,
and start
writing (open your default text editor
by double clicking on the .txt file).
Save that text file, go to your
Christendom Typesetter window, and click
New Paragraph. Select your file from the
list that pops up, and it will appear in
Christendom Typesetter! The system is set
up this way so that you are free to
split your paper up into multiple text
files, which makes finding specific
parts a lot easier. Changes you make to 
your text files will be reflected in the
Typesetter window as soon as you save
them.

### Step 4: Save your essay as PDF
Click the "Compile to PDF" button, 
and Christendom Typesetter will save your
essay as a PDF in its folder, and
automatically open it in a browser tab.
